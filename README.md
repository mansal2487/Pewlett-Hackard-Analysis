# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
For this assignment, I determined the number of retiring empoyees per title (such as Engineer) and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This is to help Pewlett Hackard prepare for a large number of employees retiring in a short period of time.

## Results
* The two jobs that have the most retiring titles by far are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.
* Two of the mangers are apart of this retiring titles worksheet.
